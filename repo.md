# b1386_pre

## 仓库简介
Fitness Windows Application in development. Tracks various fitness information for the user.

## Prompt
This is a fitness app where I need you to add a way for users to enter fitness progress (running and water) through a button on the home screen. I want users to be able to choose their units (coming from the models). And then this also should be saved to json files at "<application root>/SaveData/". Create whatever files you need to. This is going to be in a professional codebase so make sure that this adheres to best MVVM, DI, safety, and separation of concerns practices
